                        <li>Serums: This is a lightweight solution that is easily absorbed by the skin. There are many serums, such as ones that help you moisturize the skin to prevent wrinkles, while others contain ingredients that may add brightness to a dull complexion. </li>

                        <li>Creams: Cream moisturizer is a thicker, heavier solution that can hydrate excessively dry complexions. Day creams can be used as a base under your makeup, but night creams are designed to give your skin an extra dose of moisture while you sleep. </li>
                        <li>Oils: Certain oils can be a great option for those with dry, sensitive, or normal skin for further moisturizing. However, if you have acne-prone skin or struggle with acne, you should avoid oil moisturizing products.</li>
